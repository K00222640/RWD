    <p class="lead article">Delorentos will release their first ever Christmas EP on November 23rd.
'Be Here Christmas Time' features a mix of one original song of the same name, and two covers of well known seasonal covers 'Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)' and 'Winter Song'.

All proceeds from the sale of the EP will be donated to Focus Ireland this Christmas.
        'Be Here Christmas Time' is an original Delorentos tune, described by the band as a "lullaby for grownups." It celebrates the simple act of sharing time with a loved one – not the obligatory family mash-up, but time with your best pal, who gets you and accepts you. Who you can chat with into the early hours, or sit with happily in complete silence.

<h2 class="articleheading">Lorde accuses Kanye of stealing her idea, and he's delayed 'Yandhi' again</h2>
<img src="images/kanye-west-and-lorde.jpg" class="fullwid">
<p class="article">Kayne West and Kid Cudi have created a collaboration called Kids See Ghosts, and the duo performed recently at a gig in Los Angeles. Unfortunately for them, Lorde was a member of the audience and has come out to say that West has stolen her stage design. 
The New Zealand singer, who shared shots at the gig via her Instagram story, said "I’m proud of the work I do. And it’s flattering when other artists feel inspired by it, to the extent that they choose to try it on themselves. But don’t steal—not from women or anyone else—not in 2018 or ever." Lorde used a rectangular see-through box as part of her 'Melodrama' tour. </p>

        <h2 class="articleheading">Pic: Lorde apologises after posting 'bad taste' pic of a bathtub with a Whitney Houston lyric</h2>
        <img src="images/lordeshot.jpg" class="fullwid">
        

    <p class="article">When you're in the spotlight, you can't afford to put a single step wrong.

Lorde found that out yesterday after posting what she assumed to be an innocent picture of a bathtub to Instagram, captioning it with the lyric 'And iii will always love you' - a song written by Dolly Parton but of course, immortalised by Whitney Houston.

The same Whitney Houston that died after drowning in her bathtub in 2012.

It wasn't long before the Kiwi pop star was being notified of her faux-pas, and she quickly responded with an apology on Instagram stories for her 'extremely extremely poorly chosen quote' and saying that she was 'just excited to take a bath'.</p>
